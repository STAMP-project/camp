1) central maven repository to share between executors
2) add test suite for dnssd functionality
3) convert html reports to xml junit reports (could be picked up by jenkins auotmatically)
4) more jenkins slaves
5) there is alot of mass in testJar with the html report generation functionality
6) better load balancing
