# CAMP Versions

Below is the list of CAMP versions, along with a quick summary of the
changes that were made.


*   CAMP v0.7

    *   CAMP v0.7.0 (Oct. 30, 2019)

        *   Add a `-i|--include` option to `camp execute` that lets
            users specify the indexes of the configurations they want
            to execute. Thanks to
            [Fernando](http://github.com/fermenreq) and
            [Assad](http://github.com/assadOW2) for suggesting this
            feature.

*   CAMP v0.6

    *   CAMP v0.6.4 (Oct. 28, 2019)

        *   Fix [Issue
            82](https://github.com/STAMP-project/camp/issues/82) and
            avoids accumulating Docker images as CAMP iterates over
            configurations. We address the problem of multi-stages
            build that generate "dangling images". CAMP now removes
            them after each configuration, provided they are labelled
            "stage=intermediate".

    *   CAMP v0.6.3 (Sep. 30, 2019)

        *   Fix [Issue
            79](https://github.com/STAMP-project/camp/issues/79) about
            invalid build script generated by `camp realize` when
            software stacks include more than two components. Force also
            scripts to stop on first error, to ease debugging.

        *   Fix [Issue
            78](https://github.com/STAMP-project/camp/issues/78) about
            CAMP replacing FROM statements all round multistage
            Dockerfile.

    *   CAMP v0.6.2 (Sep. 26, 2019)

        *   Fix [Issue
            75](https://github.com/STAMP-project/camp/issues/75). Add
            missing constraint that forces CAMP to rule out stacks
            that contain several components that offer the same
            feature.

    *   CAMP v0.6.1 (Sep. 23, 2019)

        *   Fix [Issue
            74](https://github.com/STAMP-project/camp/issues/74). Update
            the integrity constraints that govern how CAMP stacks
            components together. CAMP thus supports "side-by-side"
            component inside software stacks.

        *   CAMP reports explicitly when it cannot find any configuration.

    *   CAMP v0.6.0 (Aug. 20, 2019)

        *   Add support for JMeter test execution, report
            collection and report aggregation. Thanks to
            [Daniele](https://github.com/danzone) for contributing
            this new feature!

        *   Add a '-v' command that display the version of the key
            dependencies, including, OS, Python, Z3 solver, Docker, and
            Docker-compose.


*   CAMP v0.5

    *   CAMP v0.5.1 (July 1, 2019)

        *   Fix [Issue
            63](https://github.com/STAMP-project/camp/issues/63). Update
            the pattern that CAMP uses to retrieve the container on
            which tests were run. Docker-compose changed naming
            convention after 1.22 and the new convention was not
            compatible with the pattern that CAMP uses anymmore.

    *   CAMP v0.5.0 (June 20, 2019)

        *   New resource selection operator at the component level (as
            opposed to the one provided at the variable level in
            v0.4.0). It enables the selection (and the rejection) of
            resources (files or directories) depending on the
            component instances included in a configuration.

*   CAMP v0.4

    *   CAMP v0.4.1 (May 14, 2019)

        *   Fix [Issue
            57](https://github.com/STAMP-project/camp/issues/57). Truncate
            the end of rewritten files to avoid that patterns replaced
            by shorter fragments (in terms of number of characters)
            lead to files having some leftovers at the end.

    *   CAMP v0.4.0 (May 7, 2019)

        *   Add new "select" realization operator. It enables the
            selection (and the rejection) of specific files from the
            template, depending on the value selected in a
            configuration and eventually renaming the selected
            resource (see the
            [documentation](https://stamp-project.github.io/camp/pages/realize.html#variables)).

*   CAMP v0.3

    *   CAMP v0.3.10 (May 5, 2019)

        *   Fix [Issue
            56](https://github.com/STAMP-project/camp/issues/53)
            about substitutions pattern that contains characters
            interpreted by the Python regular expression engine.

        *   New sample where we apply CAMP on [Ruby on
            Rails](https://github.com/STAMP-project/camp/issues/53).

        *   New sample where we apply CAMP on [the Atom
            project](https://github.com/atom/atom).

        *   Update version numbers so they include the related short Git
            commit hash (for releases).

    *   CAMP v0.3.9 (May 1, 2019)

        *   Fix [Issue
            53](https://github.com/STAMP-project/camp/issues/53) about
            the UnicodeDecodeError thrown by the ASCII codec when
            locale does not force UTF-8.

        *   Add a new sample, where we apply CAMP to test multiple
            configurations of
            [Sphinx](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx.git).

        *   Revised STAMP/Atos CityGo case study

        *   Fix [Issue
            43](https://github.com/STAMP-project/camp/issues/43) about
            the broken links into the CAMP execute documentation.

    *   CAMP v0.3.8 (Apr. 29, 2019)

        *   Fix [Issue
            49](https://github.com/STAMP-project/camp/issues/49) about
            CAMP reporting an error when tests fail during CAMP
            execute.

    *   CAMP v0.3.7 (Apr. 29, 2019)

        *   Fix [Issue
            40](https://github.com/STAMP-project/camp/issues/40) about
            vain substitution that were not reported and that went wrong
            silently.

    *   CAMP v0.3.6 (Apr. 29, 2019)

        *   Fix [Issue
            48](https://github.com/STAMP-project/camp/issues/48) about
            the `camp realize` command, which failed when a variable
            substitution targeted a file nested in a subdirectory of a
            component template.

    *   CAMP v0.3.5 (Apr. 25, 2019)

        *   Fix [Issue
            46](https://github.com/STAMP-project/camp/issues/46) about
            failing string concatenation in the UI during `camp
            execute`.

    *   CAMP v0.3.4 (Apr. 12, 2019)

        *   Expose the parameter of CAMP execute in the CAMP model.

        *   Add a new Python example following the Java Greetings example.

        *   Move to Green 2.15.0, which generates JUnit reports (see
            [Issue 104](https://guthub.com/cleancut/green/issue/104)).

        *   Drop the tecor tool that was in the repository under the
            `modules` directory. This is replaced by CAMP execute.

    *   CAMP v0.3.3 (Apr. 9, 2019)

        *   Move to Green 2.14.2. Fix [Issue
            203](https://github.com/cleancut/green/issues/203) about the
            'GreenStream' object that had no attribute 'encoding' when
            capturing tests's output.

        *   Port to Python 3.5. Runs now on both Python 2.7 and 3.5.

    *   CAMP v0.3.2 (Apr. 3, 2019)

        *   Merge with [Pull Request
            38](https://github.com/STAMP-project/camp/pull/38) that
            contains the case-study from ActiveEon.

        *   Test CAMP against multiple versions of Z3 (4.8.4, 4.7.1 and
            4.6) using Travis Matrix Build.

    *   CAMP v0.3.1 (Apr. 1, 2019)

        *   Fix [Issue
            35](https://github.com/STAMP-project/camp/issues/35) by
            using `docker cp` to fetch test reports, instead of
            mounting volumes.

        *   Fix [Issue
            27](https://github.com/STAMP-project/camp/issues/27) with
            revision of the installation documentation that pointed to
            CAMP v1.0.0, which does not exists yet.

        *   Fix [Issue
            33](https://github.com/STAMP-project/camp/issues/33) by
            taking into account the presence of `settings.xml` to
            avoid Maven to create local repository in a directory that
            does not exist.

        *   Fix [Issue
            32](https://github.com/STAMP-project/camp/issues/32) and
            move dependencies from `requirements.txt` to
            `setup.py`. Add an alternative installation procedure,
            which does not requires docker.
